# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Solution `ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2.sln` ties together three library projects stored in `src/` (core library plus ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core MVC helpers). Sample and verification sites live in `test/` (e.g., `TestWebAppCore`, `TestIdPCore`, Key Vault demos) and mirror hosting models to reproduce IdP/RP conversations before publishing packages. NuGet artifacts are emitted only from the library folders; keep sample-specific assets there to avoid polluting the shipping assemblies.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `dotnet restore ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2.sln` - fetches every target framework dependency.
- `dotnet build ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2.sln -c Release` - runs multi-targeted builds and produces signed binaries.
- `dotnet pack src/ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2/ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2.csproj -c Release` - prepares the NuGet package used for public releases.
- `dotnet run --project test/TestWebAppCore/TestWebAppCore.csproj` - exercises SP initiated, redirect, and post bindings locally.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Use 4-space indentation, braces on new lines, and `PascalCase` for public types/members. Locals stay `camelCase`, while persistent private fields use `_camelCase`. Keep namespaces explicit (`ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2.*`) so bindings, cryptography helpers, and MVC extensions remain discoverable. Retain XML doc comments on public APIs; warnings `1591` and `1573` are suppressed only when documentation exists. Prefer guard clauses such as `ArgumentNullException(nameof(config))` and run `dotnet format` (or the equivalent IDE formatter) before submitting work.

## Testing Guidelines
Automated coverage is minimal today, so rely on the runnable apps in `test/` for regression checks. Follow the existing `Test<Context><Host>` naming pattern for any new scenario. If you introduce formal test projects, wire them into the solution so `dotnet test ITfoxtec.Identity.Saml2.sln` succeeds. Capture manual test notes covering IdP metadata, signing certificates, Key Vault references, and RelayState expectations inside the relevant `test/*` README.

## Security & Configuration Tips
Do not commit secrets or real certificates. Sample apps should load configuration via environment variables, `dotnet user-secrets`, or Azure Key Vault, matching the `TestWebAppCoreAzureKeyVault` example. When sharing traces, sanitize assertions, entity IDs, and thumbprints. Validate new bindings against trusted IdPs (Azure AD, AD FS, NemLog-in) before merging to avoid regressions for both SP and IdP consumers.
